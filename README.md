# Reviewing 4 Influential Albums: In my opinion.
**Music. is. Everywhere.** From the snaps and claps of your hands to the big hits you hear on the radio, we can't escape from the inevitable sound of music. It touches a special part of our souls and serves as a form of communication words can't always express.
Music serves as a pedestal in my daily life, constantly searching for songs to bring or express a certain emotion or mood. However, there's some artists and songs I listen to more greatly than other ones which is why I'll be reviewing the 4 albums that have a special place in my life: from artwork, production or themes, I'll be uncovering it all.
## _Graduation_-Kanye West

Released in 2007, Graduation explores the themes of fame and wealth while also protruding quality of life after Kanye's "graduation" from college. His songs are different in tempo and beats from his last 2 albums, _College Dropout_ and _Late Registration_. West introduces a variety of electro and rock elements combined with the contrastingly slow tempos in some songs like Barry Bonds, I Wonder and Everything I Am. The artwork of this album is unique and distinct from other album covers. The bear which appeared on his previous 2 albums, is being shot out of a cannon to illustrate life after college, all by yourself. Listening to this album always gives me feelings of joy, nostalgia and happiness through the uptempo of the instrumentals. An album that can be played for any occassion or relating to feelings, Kanye definitely introduced a new type of rap and meaning not only to hip-hop, but music worldwide.
### _Destiny Fulfilled_-Destiny's Child
